    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>We implemented a physics simulator to simulate a cloth (falling, stretching, and folding through internal and external forces). Then we added shaders (simulating lighting/texture effects) to make
      the cloth look more realistic. Specifically, ideas include the spring-model of particles (to simulate the cloth pulling/stretching on itself); the effects of changing physical properties of the cloth; interactions
      with both self and other objects (using collisions); and shaders and textures. An important overarching idea is how different parameters (judgment calls for the designer) can drastically affect how 
      a simulated object behaves--and is therefore perceived (from the "weight" of dense cloths, to the "realism" of self-folding). Moreover, careful choice in these parameters, along with some advanced techniques
      like certain GLSL shaders, can make a scene feel much more vivid and tangible (e.g. displacement mapping gives the sphere a clear tactile "weight").

  <h2 align="middle">Part II</h2>
  <p>The effects of changing the spring constant ks, amount to making the cloth "bouncier". A high spring constant will
    make the cloth stiffer, while a lower one will make it more flexible/bouncy. With a very low ks, the cloth will 
    fall further (the center stretches down more), and it will ripple flexibly. In contrast, a high ks appears to behave
    more smoothly, and it does not stretch much at all (at rest, it is nearly flat, as opposed to a curved parabolic shape
    for low ks).
  </p>
  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>Density mainly affects how far the cloth falls. Notably, dense (heavy) cloths will also fall further and come to rest
    at a more bent position (less dense rests more flatly). When the cloth falls farther, it will have more space to jiggle/bounce.
    (However, for a vertical cloth, lower density does decrease inertia to the point where it does jiggle/wrinkle more).

  </p>

          <img src="images/2_2_1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
          <figcaption>high density. The cloth falls farther (which allows for more expression of wrinkling along

      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>Damping affects both how fast the cloth falls, as well as counteracting minor jiggling/wrinkling. A high damping
    setting will make it as if the cloth is falling through water (high dissipation of energy kills off temporary spring
    forces between particles quicker, and the motion is primarily dominated by gravity). A low damping setting will
    conversely make the cloth fall faster, and also bounce, jiggle, and wrinkle a lot more.

  <p>Here are the cloth and sphere with 3 different ks's. Since the ks determines the cloth's flexibility (low ks
    = more flexible), lower ks cloths drape themselves over the cloth more loosely ("naturally"), while higher ks
    cloths don't bend fully over the sphere (they touch the sphere a bit less, and rest more widely instead of wrapping
    around the sphere.)

            and more like waves/undulations.

            non-colliding particles); but this causes the cloth to bunch/crumple more instead of folding. 
            This is because the top of the cloth is not really affected much by the crumpling at the bottom; so 
            the entire cloth falls more or less on the center axis.

          <figcaption>ks=50000. In contrast, a bigger ks causes the cloth to "pull on itself" more tightly. 
            This results in more folding rather than crumpling. This is because the top of the cloth interacts
            more with the bottom (it "knows" to fall in a different pattern). (Increasing ks behaves similarly
            to increasing density.)

  <h2 align="middle">Part V</h2>
  <p>(1) A shader program is a program that runs efficiently on the GPU to calculate
    parts of an image/scene's graphics. It can take multiple vectors as input, but it
    always returns one 4D vector. Vertex shaders often modify individual vertices, as
    well as processing them and then passing that information (varyings) to the fragment
    shaders. Fragment shaders operate on fragments (basically, individual pixels, not
    as big as the antialising "fragments" from earlier in class). They decide (output)
    the color of the pixel (into out_color). Therefore, vertex shaders process general
    geometric information, and then we narrow our processing to individual fragments (pixels),
    which finally decides what color every part of the screen is, with that previous geometry
    in mind.
  </p>
  <p>(2) The Blinn-Phong shading model is a simplification of more detailed lighting
    algorithms (like raytracing). It consists of an ambient, diffuse, and specular term.
    In other words, we approximate global lighting as a single ambient term. The diffuse
    and specular terms also simulate a "bounce" of lighting; the diffuse term simulates
    the material as a diffuse material that reflects light evenly in every direction (instead of a complex
     3D or 4D transfer function that custom-varies on input/output angle). The specular
     term similarly simulates the effect of glossy materials bouncing light based
     on the incident angle, and the outgoing angle (to the camera/viewer).

  <br>
  <p>(4) Here are the screenshots of bump and displacement mapping. Bump mapping just draws on shaded textures, but it doesn't change the geometry of the objects. Displacement mapping does change
    the geometry (moves vertices around, with height based on texture). Displacement mapping looks more realistic, but it may require a finer mesh to look nice (see next section).

  <p>Here are screenshots with varying mesh coarsenesses. If we don't have a fine-enough mesh, then the displacement mapping looks odd (not enough resolution to capture the geometry in the texture).
    With a finer mesh though, we can capture all of the complexity in the mesh, resulting in a much nicer looking image (the brick texture looks more "real", and it is better captured in the sphere's
    vertex displacements).
